# JustAnotherExpenseTracker

JustAnotherExpenseTracker is a WPF app created using .NET 8.0 to allow users to track and monitor their expenses. 

* It makes use of RESTful APIs to get the data to be displayed. The API part of the project is implemented [here](https://github.com/leoJ424/ExpenseTrackerWebAPI_Mk2). 

* This works with a flutter app created here to get the data from the user. [Code](https://github.com/leoJ424/Flutter_JustAnotherExpenseTracker)

Currently this app allows the user to enter credit card transactions. The details of the credit card, amount of money spent, graphical representations of when the money was spent, the top categories of expenditure and detailed view of each transaction can be seen in this version. 

This can be considered as a base version on which I plan to add many more features. First of which being extending the functionality to add debit card/bank transactions and also transactions involving the purchases of stocks and display suitable analytics for the same.

Take a look at the [video](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1ksRjRKZD9lmJK9bU0dWTErtpzg5X1KGD/view?usp=sharing) showing some of the features.



* The app was mainly created to revise the concepts of .NET, a technology that I had worked on during my first job in the industry.

* The API side of the project involves the use of RESTful APIs and also used JSON Web Tokens for authentications and role-based authorizations.

* The companion flutter app was created so that I could get my hands dirty with flutter and seemed like the best way to learn a new framework.
